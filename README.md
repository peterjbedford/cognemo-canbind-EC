# cognemo-canbind-EC
Required for analysis of EC from paper, Combining Functional Network Dynamics and Effective Connectivity for Classification of Major Depression based on Resting-State fMRI

## Analysis
The script 'pipeline.m' was used to run the analysis, wherein effective connectivity was used as input. Effective connectivity was produced using the rDCM set of tools from the TAPAS toolbox https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8206497/.

## Visualization
The script 'visualize.m' was used to produce the visualizations. These visualizations relied in part on the Subaxis - Subplot and circularGraph packages from the Matlab FileExchange (Subaxis - Subplot: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/3696-subaxis-subplot / circularGraph: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/48576-circulargraph).
